            <!-- Introduction Section -->
            <div class="mb-4">
                <h4>Introduction</h4>
                <p>
                    Fault calculations are critical in the design and operation of electrical power systems. They help engineers ensure the system remains safe and reliable during abnormal conditions such as short circuits, line-to-line faults, or ground faults. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Symmetrical components, introduced by Charles Fortescue, form the basis for analyzing unbalanced systems. By decomposing unbalanced systems into balanced sets, engineers can simplify complex fault scenarios.

            </div>

            <!-- Symmetrical Components Section -->
            <div class="mb-4">
                <h4>What Are Symmetrical Components?</h4>
                <p>
                    Symmetrical components are a mathematical tool used to simplify the analysis of unbalanced three-phase systems. They break down an unbalanced system into three sets of balanced components:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Positive Sequence:</strong> Balanced system rotating in the original phase sequence.</li>
                    <li><strong>Negative Sequence:</strong> Balanced system rotating in the reverse phase sequence.</li>
                    <li><strong>Zero Sequence:</strong> Identical components in all three phases.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Using these components, engineers can analyze faults such as single-phase-to-ground, line-to-line, and three-phase faults with ease.

            <!-- Fault Analysis Section -->
            <div class="mb-4">
                <h4>Fault Analysis and Calculations</h4>
                <p>
                    Fault analysis involves determining the current and voltage levels during a fault condition. This is essential for selecting appropriate protective devices and ensuring system stability.
                </p>
                <h5>Key Steps in Fault Analysis:</h5>
                <ol>
                    <li>Identify the type of fault (e.g., single-line-to-ground, double-line-to-ground).</li>
                    <li>Determine system parameters such as source impedance and line impedance.</li>
                    <li>Calculate fault current using symmetrical components and equivalent circuits.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    For example, consider a single-phase fault at Point A in the system below (Figure 1). The fault current can be calculated as:
                </p>
                <p class="text-center text-muted fst-italic">Fault Current (I<sub>fault</sub>) = V<sub>source</sub> / Z<sub>total</sub></p>
